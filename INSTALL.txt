== Requirements ==

Before you start to install OpenStreetMineCraft Web, check these requirements.

* Make sure you have installed the core tool OpenStreetMineCraft.
* Check if your OSM2PGSQL style file contains the attributes listed in res/default.style. You can use directly this file.
  If you don't want to change your default.style file, you have to edit the OSMCCSS (src/osmccss/default/style.osmccss) to make
  it fit to your database.
* You have a working web server, with PHP and PHP CURL extension installed.

== Install ==

To make OpenStreeMineCraft available on your own web server, you have to follow these instructions.

* Place all the content of src/ folder in the destination directory of your server (probably under /var/www/html).

* Edit the res/osmcd.service file
** Change this line : ''user=adrien'' by the web server system user (probably apache)
** Change the access path to the src/render.php file
** You may also have to change the command of PHP, replace /usr/bin/php by your own
* Move the osmcd.service file in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/
* Reload system daemons to add osmcd service, as root : ''systemctl daemon-reload''

* Edit src/config.php file, to make it fit to your system configuration.

* Enable the osmcd service at start-up, as root : ''systemctl enable osmcd.service''
* Start the osmcd service, as root : ''systemctl start osmcd.service''

And it's done, your website is ready.

== Read-me ==
OpenStreetMineCraft is a tool to convert OpenStreetMap data into Minecraft maps. This software is splited into two parts :
* OpenStreetMineCraft: the core tool, written in Java and usable with command-line
* OpenStreetMineCraft Web: the web interface for the previous tool, the piece of software you're installing

The web interface allows users to create maps, see last created maps, and know a little more about the project.
For a demo instance, you can go here: https://osmc.pavie.info/
